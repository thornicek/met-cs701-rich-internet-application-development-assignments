# CS701 Assignment 11

# Part 1

For part 1, I start from the code available at https://angular.io/generated/zips/toh-pt4/toh-pt4.zip. That is a functioning tour-of-heros application with implemented HeroService and MessageService. I added the Routing following instruction on the Angular site. 

# Part 2

For part 2, I used the Ionic and the Angular to build a Photo Gallery. I build an application that could capture random photos and that they would display on the grid on tab 2.
