# CS701 Assignment 5

For assignment 5, I have created a shopping cart application, using the AngularJS module. The user interface allows the user to enter and save, different books, along with their titles, quantity, unit price, total price of the same books and the overall total cost. The Remove button removes the respective book from the model. The view is automatically updated. The New button will add a new book object to the model. Clicking on this button will insert one new book each time it is clicked. After one click, the layout is shown below.The Save button stores the list of current books and their state into Local Storage. When the application is loaded, it checks in the local storage first if the books are already stored. If they are, use the stored data for the application. If the item is not there in local storage,
the default list of books is shown. Use a single key named HornicekCart in the local storage for managing the state of the shopping cart.
