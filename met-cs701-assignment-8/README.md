# CS701 Assignment 8

# Part 1

For part 1, I install Angular on my machine and identified the version you installed. As proof, I created a new Angular app and named the app myng.  The code for part 1 can be found in the folder Part1.

# Part 2

For part 2, I separately ran commands ng build and ng serve –open. I then documented, the difference and effects on the directory structure and the files in the application directory, in the file Part2.pdf. 
# Part 3

For part 3, I created an Angular application and added a hello-world component to my application. The component paints text “Hello YourName”, if the name of the HelloComponent class is set to “YourName”. YourName is my actual name; Tomas Hornicek. I implemented the component with a separate, external, template and style files. . i then showed, that I can demonstrate that i can control the color in my css file by setting attribute color of my HelloComponent class. The code for part 3 can be found in the folder Part3.


# Part 4

For part 4, I created another component similar to the one in the previous problem. This component prints current date and time. I tehn demonstrated that I can control the appearance of the date-time text using pipes and property dataFromat of my component class. I added this component to the root module of the application. The code for part 4 can be found in the folder Part4.
