# CS701 Assignment 1

# Part 1

For part 1, I created an object representing a car. Let the object have attributes representing color, make,model and production year. Added a method that would display concatenated values of car’s model and year. Implemented my object using the Prototype pattern. Demonstrated that I could redefine object’s method so that it displays vehicle model and color.  

# Part 2

For part 2, I demonstrated that in JavaScript you can implement inheritance using prototype chaining. I created a supertype Vehicle and a subtype Truck. I made the object Truck has additional attributes: driver, capacityInTons and emptyWeight. I also implemented a method that would return totalWeight = emptyWeight + capacityInTons, in the Truck object. I also demonstrated that I could populate values of a Bus object and present results of its methods both on a web page and in console.
