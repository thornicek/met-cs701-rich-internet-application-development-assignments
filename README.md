# CS701 Web Application Development Assignments

This repository contains all my assignments I did for my Rich Internet Application Development course. The class concentrates primarly on  building rich client web applications in the browser for desktop and mobile devices. The course is divided into various modules covering in depth the following technologies: HTML5, AngularJS, and Ionic framework. Along with the fundamentals underlying these technologies, several applications are showcased as case studies.

All assignments that are using the AngularJS framework, are missing the node modules, which need to be downloaded, in order for the applications to work (run npm install in terminal).
