# CS701 Assignment 3

# Part 1

For part 1, I have donwloaded the following audio file: file_example_MP3_700KB.mp3 and created a small html page; part1.html, which plays the downloaded file.

# Part 2

For part 2, I have downloaded the following video file: Sample-MP4-Video-File-for-Testing.mp4 and created a small html page; part1.html, which plays the downloaded file.

# Part 3

For part 3, I have edited a form sample, provided by the professor. I have added a custom handler of invalid values, entered into the edited form. Similarly, I added a JavaScript validator that will verify that two copies of an email address are identical. The code for part 3 can be found in part3.html and part3.js.

# Part 4

For part 4, I modified the form from part 3. At the top I added a text field with a description of the form or an instruction to the person who is filling in the form. At the bottom I added a region, where the user can drag and drop the text of that description.  I also modified the drop handler so that it remove the text from the top. The code for part 4 can be found in part4.html and part4.js.

# Part 5

For part 5, I have used the Geolocation API, to build a form, which would give the user, every 5 seconds the current and  longitude and latitude, and the start longitude and latitude. Each time the user moves, the update number is incremented. The code for part 5 can be found in LocationTracker.html and LocationTracker.js.
