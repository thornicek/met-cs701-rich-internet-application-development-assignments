# CS701 Assignment 2

# Part 1

For part 1, I used the HTML5 Canvas API, to develop an application that would draw a bulleye pattern using bullsEye.html and bullsEye.js. I used the canvas of size 400 x 400. I then used a loop to draw the pattern, alternating between red and blue filled circles, using the initial band width value of 25. I then repeated the loop as long as the current radius is greater than 0, with implementing a slider to control the band width. The slider has a minimum value of 5, maximum value of 50 with step 5, and current value as 25. As the value of the slider changes, I programmed the canvas to draw the pattern with the current bandwidth.

# Part 2

For part 2, I used the HTML5 Canvas API to develop an application as shown in the following link:

When the user clicks with the mouse on the canvas, a filled circle of size of 30 is drawn at the clicked point. A random color is used for each mouse click.  The code, for the first part of Part 2, resides in the files circles1.html and circles1.js. 

I then modified the application so that any overlapping circles are hidden when a new circle is being drawn at the clicked point as shown in the following link:

The code, for the first part of Part 2, resides  in the files circles2.html and circles2.js.

# Part 3

For part 3, I used the HTML5 SVG API, to implement the following animation in the file svg/part2.html:
